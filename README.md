Synopsis: 
Help Miles Get Home is a simple iOS application that uses the Core Location framework to demonstrate the concepts of Ranging and Region Monitoring with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Beacons. 

The purpose of this application is to demonstrate one of the many use cases BLE Beacons can provide i.e. detection of movement of a smart device as its proximity to a configured BLE beacon changes over time. This detection capability can provide the basis for user engagement based on location.

This application relies on the following UUID being configured for operation: E2C56DB5-DFFB-48D2-0001-D0F5A71096E0

Motivation:
The application was written to help educate interested people about the power of location based engagement using BLE beacons.
